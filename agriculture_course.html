            <p>Agriculture is the science, art and practice of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was 
                the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated 
                species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture
                 began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, 
                 nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated 
                 over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. 
                 Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate
                  agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological 
                    developments have sharply increased yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental 
                    damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the 
                    output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental
                     issues include contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic
                     resistance, and growth hormones in industrial meat production. Agriculture is also very sensitive to
                      environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation and global 
                      warming, 
                    which cause decrease in crop yield.[2] Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some 
                    are banned in certain countries.

                    The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials 
                    (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, fungi
                     and eggs. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the 
                     
                service sector, although in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural 
                workers continues, especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by
                
                industrial agriculture and mechanization. Creating a global sustainable food systems which provides
                 food security with sustainable agriculture practices is an international policy priority articulated
                  in Sustainable Development Goal 2: "Zero hunger".[3]</p>
