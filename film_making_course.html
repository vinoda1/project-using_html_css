        <p>Filmmaking (or, in any context, film production) is the process by which a film is made. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete
             stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and pre-production, editing, 
             and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and an exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places 
             around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques.</p>
             <p>How do you get started with filmmaking, and make short movies or videos that people will want to watch?</p>
             <p>You need to:</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Choose the right equipment</li>
                 <li>Learn how films tell stories</li>
                 <li>Develop your story idea  </li>
                 <li>Plan your shots and sound</li>
                 <li>Film and edit the movie carefully</li>
                 <li>Get feedback before you finish</li>
                 <li>Share it in the right format</li>
             </ol>
             <p>Tip: Before you start on a big filmmaking project, make some simple short movies to build
                  your skills.  So if you’re planning to make a documentary, make a mini-documentary to practise. If you’re planning a drama, 
                  try filming a single scene.
