            <p>A textile[1] is a flexible material made by creating an interlocking network of yarns or threads, 
                which are produced by spinning raw fibres (from either natural or synthetic sources) into long and 
                twisted lengths.[2] Textiles are then formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, tatting, 
                felting, bonding or braiding these yarns together.

                The related words "fabric"[3] and "cloth"[4] and "material" are often used in textile assembly 
                trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle 
               differences in these terms in specialized usage. A textile is any material made of the interlacing fibres, 
               including carpeting and geotextiles, which may not necessarily be used in the production of further 
               goods, such as clothing and upholstery. A fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, felting,
                stitching, crocheting or bonding that may be used in the production of further products, such as clothing and upholstery, 
                thus requiring a further step of the production. Cloth may also be used synonymously with fabric, but often specifically 
                refers to a piece of fabric that has been processed or cut.</p>
